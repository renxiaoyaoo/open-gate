# Deployment

## Node.js and SQLite

Node.js is the portable default and requires no Cloudflare services. Configure `.env.local`, run `npm run build:node`, then `npm run start:node`. Persist the directory containing `OPENHOME_DATABASE_PATH` and terminate TLS at a reverse proxy.

## Docker

Build from `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`, mount `/app/web/data`, and pass configuration as environment variables or secrets. The image runs the standard Next.js server and local SQLite.

## Cloudflare Workers and D1

The Cloudflare adapter is optional. Set `OPENHOME_CF_DATABASE_ID` and optionally `OPENHOME_CF_DATABASE_NAME`, `OPENHOME_CF_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`, and `OPENHOME_ACCESS_ENABLED=1` in the private deployment environment, configure Worker secrets, then run `npm run cf:deploy` from `web`. The generated `web/wrangler.production.jsonc` is ignored. No account ID, database UUID, custom domain, or secret belongs in this repository.

To sync an ignored private environment file through a deployment host without retaining a remote plaintext copy, run `deploy/cloudflare/sync-via-ssh.sh <ssh-target> <remote-repo-root> [private-env-file]`. The remote temporary file is removed automatically after Wrangler updates the Worker secrets.

`OPENHOME_SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is deployment-owned key material. Generate or rotate it with `node deploy/cloudflare/rotate-session-key.mjs .env.deploy.local --yes`, then sync the secrets. The tool uses 32 cryptographically random bytes encoded as 64 hexadecimal characters. Rotation deliberately makes existing stored sessions unreadable, so every account must log in again.

Provider compatibility is installed as a schema-versioned bundle. Configure `OPENHOME_PROVIDER_BUNDLE_URL` and `OPENHOME_PROVIDER_BUNDLE_TOKEN` in the ignored private deployment environment, then run `node deploy/cloudflare/sync-secrets.mjs .env.deploy.local` from the repository root. The deployment command fetches the bundle over HTTPS and streams it directly into the Worker secret store; it does not save or print the bundle. Each deployer is responsible for an authorized compatible configuration source.
